# Beall's-C list 2.0 for predatory publishers

Welcome!

This project intends to create an Open Access community managed alternative to the infamous 'Beall's list' of 'predatory publishers'. Blacklists are generally not great for this sort of thing, but Beall's list is widely used still. So, instead of using a list based on criteria that have been shown to be deeply flawed, why not build one that's actually decent for people who insist on using blacklists anyway?

## Rough protocol

1. Find a copy of Beall's original criteria
2. Put those criteria here
3. Dissect them and parse them apart
4. Make them rigorous, evidence-based, and well, useful
5. Discard crap criteria, design new ones where appropriate
6. Re-map criteria
7. Release Beall's-C* list 2.0 for predatory publishers

* The 'C' here clearly stands for 'Criteria'. It is a pure coincidence that it happens to also be an anagram of "Cabell's", the main black/whitelist journal service out there.

Thanks in advance to Jeffrey Beall for laying the foundations for making this work possible.
