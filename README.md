# Beall-s'-C list 2.0 for predatory publishers

Welcome!

This project intends to create an Open Access community managed alternative to the infamous 'Beall's list' of 'predatory publishers'.

## Rough protocol

1. Find a copy of Beall's original criteria
2. Put those criteria here
3. Dissect them and parse them apart
4. Make them rigorous, evidence-based, and well, useful
5. Discard crap criteria, design new ones where appropriate
6. Re-map criteria
7. Release Beall's-C* list 2.0 for predatory publishers

* The 'C' here clearly stands for 'Criteria'. It is a pure coincidence that it happens to also be an anagram of "Cabell's", the main black/whitelist journal service out there.

Thanks in advance to Jeffrey Beall for laying the foundations for making this work possible.
